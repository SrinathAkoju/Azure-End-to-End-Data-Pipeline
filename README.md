# Azure End-to-End-Data Pipeline Project
 A cloud-based data engineering + analytics workflow using ADLS Gen2, ADF, Databricks, Azure SQL, and Power BI.

## Project Summary

This project showcases an end-to-end cloud data pipeline on Microsoft Azure, built from a data analyst’s perspective with strong engineering fundamentals.

The pipeline ingests raw data, transforms it into analytics-ready datasets using Azure Databricks, and exposes curated Gold-layer views through Azure Synapse Serverless SQL for downstream analysis and reporting.

## Why This Project

As a Data Analyst transitioning into a broader Data Professional role, this project demonstrates:

Ownership of the entire data lifecycle
Strong understanding of cloud analytics architecture
Ability to bridge business analytics and data engineering

This project was created as part of my Azure learning journey while preparing for **DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals)**.

## 🏗 Architecture

[![Azure-End-to-End-Pipeline](architecture.jpeg)](architecture.jpeg)

**This architecture follows the Azure Medallion pattern (Bronze → Silver → Gold) using ADF for ingestion, Databricks for transformation, and Power BI for reporting.**

## End-to-End Data Flow
1️⃣ Data Ingestion — Bronze Layer

Source data (AdventureWorks datasets) is ingested using Azure Data Factory

Pipelines are parameterized to handle multiple datasets

Raw data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Bronze layer) without modification

2️⃣ Data Transformation — Silver Layer

Azure Databricks (PySpark) is used to clean and transform raw data

Schema standardization, data type normalization, and basic cleansing applied

Transformed data is stored in ADLS Gen2 (Silver layer) in Parquet format

3️⃣ Analytics & Serving — Gold Layer

Azure Synapse Serverless SQL is used to create curated analytical views

Views are built using OPENROWSET over Parquet files

No dedicated SQL infrastructure required

Gold views are optimized for BI tools and ad-hoc analysis

4️⃣ Curated Storage (Optional Materialization)

Gold views are also materialized as external tables in ADLS Gen2

Enables reuse and structured access for downstream consumers

5️⃣ Security & Access

Secure access via Azure Managed Identity

Storage access controlled using Azure RBAC

No secrets or keys stored in code
